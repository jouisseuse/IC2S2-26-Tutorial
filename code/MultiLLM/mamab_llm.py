"""
LLM-based MAMAB simulation — unequal-productivity condition.

Each agent is a GPT-4o instance that reads a running summary of arm outcomes
and responds with its next arm choice. In the social learning condition, the
summary reflects pooled outcomes from all agents; in the asocial condition,
each agent sees only its own history.

State is checkpointed after every round so interrupted runs can resume.

Usage:
    Set OPENAI_API_KEY and optional OPENAI_BASE_URL environment variables, then run:
        python mamab_llm.py

    For a quick tutorial run, you can also paste values into DIRECT_API_KEY and
    DIRECT_OPENAI_BASE_URL below. Do not commit real API keys.
